To build a game like this with a smooth, futuristic WebGL design, Iâ€™d suggest the following stack:

Tech Stack & Tools
	1.	Three.js â€“ For WebGL-based rendering (3D effects, particle animations, glowing UI).
	2.	GSAP â€“ For smooth animations and transitions.
	3.	Howler.js â€“ If you need interactive sound effects.
	4.	Capacitor.js â€“ To compile for mobile (iOS/Android).
	5.	Vite.js â€“ For fast development and bundling.

Game Concept & Core Mechanics
	â€¢	Player Controls: A circular entity moves across a 3D space (mouse/touch controls).
	â€¢	Objective: Catch glowing orbs (or bubbles) that appear dynamically.
	â€¢	Scoring: Based on how accurately you align with the incoming orbs.
	â€¢	Speed Increases: The game progressively becomes harder.
	â€¢	Background: A dynamic particle field that reacts to the playerâ€™s movement.

Steps to Build It Quickly
	1.	Set Up a Three.js Scene
	â€¢	Create a WebGLRenderer, Scene, and Camera.
	â€¢	Use PlaneGeometry for the game floor.
	â€¢	Add a glowing effect using ShaderMaterial.
	2.	Create the Player (Circle)
	â€¢	Use a CircleGeometry with a glowing MeshBasicMaterial.
	â€¢	Move the player using mousemove or touch events.
	3.	Spawn Incoming Bubbles
	â€¢	Generate SphereGeometry objects dynamically.
	â€¢	Make them move toward the player.
	4.	Collision Detection
	â€¢	Use bounding box intersections (Box3().intersectsBox()).
	â€¢	If the player touches an orb, increase the score.
	5.	UI & Effects
	â€¢	Use GSAP to animate UI elements (fade-in/out).
	â€¢	Add background particle effects for a futuristic look.
	6.	Compile with Capacitor for Mobile
	â€¢	Run npx cap add android or npx cap add ios to deploy.

Bonus Enhancements
	â€¢	Haptic Feedback (on mobile) when collecting a bubble.
	â€¢	Neon Glow Shader to enhance visuals.
	â€¢	Dynamic Audio Sync (match visuals with background music).
